# Go Fail-Fast Wiring

## Goal

Move required dependency validation to construction and startup time.
Do not let runtime business code absorb wiring failures.

## When to use

Use this skill when:

- `ServiceContext`, jobs, handlers, or logic structs are full of `nil` checks
- business methods contain branches like `if svcCtx == nil { return nil }`
- a dependency is actually required, but the code treats it as optional
- wiring errors surface only after requests reach business logic
- `nil` is being used to mean "feature disabled"

## Core principles

- Required dependency problems belong to startup, not business runtime.
- If a required dependency is missing, fail construction or startup immediately.
- Runtime code should assume required dependencies are valid.
- Do not pollute happy paths with impossible-state guards.
- Do not use `nil` to represent optional behavior; use explicit config or noop implementations.
- Prefer local assignment-time checks over large late validation layers.

## Working approach

1. Separate required dependencies from truly optional ones.
2. Make constructors such as `NewServiceContext`, `NewXxxJob`, `NewXxxServer`, and `NewXxxLogic` enforce required dependencies.
3. Check each required dependency near the point where it is created or assigned.
4. Return `error` from constructors when required dependencies are missing.
5. Handle startup failure in `main` and stop booting.
6. Remove runtime `nil` guards that cannot happen on the normal startup path.
7. For optional capability, use explicit config flags or noop implementations.

## Preferred patterns

### 1. Fail fast during startup

Preferred:

```go
serverCtx, err := svc.NewServiceContext(c)
if err != nil {
    logx.Errorf("init service context failed: %v", err)
    panic(err)
}
```

Do not defer required dependency failures to runtime business code.

### 2. Check required dependencies at creation time

Preferred:

```go
repo, err := mysqlstore.New(c.MySQL)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
if repo == nil {
    return nil, errors.New("mysql repository is nil")
}
```

Prefer checks close to assignment instead of a large late-stage validator.

### 3. Remove impossible runtime guards

If startup guarantees a valid object graph, code like this is usually dead defensive code:

```go
if j == nil || j.svcCtx == nil || j.svcCtx.RoomState == nil {
    return nil
}
```

### 4. Represent optional behavior explicitly

Avoid:

```go
if limiter == nil {
    return nil
}
```

Prefer:

```go
if !cfg.SignalRateLimit.Enabled {
    return nil
}
```

## Common smells

- `if svcCtx == nil { return nil }`
- `if repo == nil { return nil }`
- `if j == nil || j.svcCtx == nil || ...`
- production code carrying nil guards only to support half-built test objects
- large `ensureXxx` or `validateXxx` layers added to hide wiring problems instead of fixing them at construction time

## Removal criteria

Remove a runtime nil guard only when all are true:

- the object is created through a controlled constructor path
- the constructor path already guarantees required dependencies
- the value cannot be nil on the normal startup path
- the nil branch does not carry real business meaning

If any of these are false, do not remove the guard mechanically.

## Test guidance

- Do not keep meaningless runtime nil guards just to accommodate lazy test setup.
- Prefer constructors, builders, or explicit test wiring helpers.
- If tests need mocks, solve that in test setup rather than polluting production happy paths.

## Expected outcomes

Applied well, this skill should produce:

- required dependency failures that move to startup
- shorter, cleaner business paths
- fewer impossible runtime nil branches
- explicit optional behavior
- clearer separation between wiring and business concerns
